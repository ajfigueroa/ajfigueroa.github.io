In 2018, on a likely humid day in Toronto I gave a talk about Auto Layout at a developer event called tacow. Here are some notes and the slides from that talk.

The summary of my talk was as follows:

> Have you ever wondered why we do things a certain way in Auto Layout? Are you worried it's too late to ask these questions? In this talk, we'll look at some common patterns in Auto Layout and do a deeper dive into how they came to be. This talk will indirectly cover some best practices for making your app UI scale to many devices.

As one gains more experience with software development, we often don't think back about why we do certain things that have over time become muscle memory.
I find this especially true when it comes to libraries such as Auto Layout.

I wanted to take the time to deep dive on a topic that I considered myself proficient in and dig into some of the fundamentals that I may have not fully understood.
I had a lot of fun investigating and learning about the history of Auto Layout with this talk.

I hope you find it useful!

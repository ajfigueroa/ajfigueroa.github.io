### Setup

Assuming you have npm, bundler, and gulp installed:
- NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/
- Gulp: https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start

Lastly, make sure you have installed the latest version of Xcode.

You can clone the repo and run the following commands:
```
npm install
bundle install
gulp [default] 
```

Alternatively, you can just run:
```
rake run
```

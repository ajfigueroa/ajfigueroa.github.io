My name is Alex Figueroa and I'm an iOS Developer from the far away land of Toronto, ON.

I am currently working at Wattpad and any opinions made here are completely my own (but that should go without saying).

Outside of programming, I'm really into reading, playing guitar, and taking photographs of food or the great outdoors.

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}), [Github](https://www.github.com/{{ site.github_username }}), 
and now [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/{{ site.wattpad_username }}).

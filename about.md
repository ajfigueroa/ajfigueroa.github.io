My name is Alex and I'm an iOS Engineer from the far away land of Toronto, ON.

I currently work at [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com) and any opinions made here are completely my own.

Outside of programming, I'm really into reading, playing guitar, and taking photographs of people or city landscapes.

Check out my photographs on [500px](https://500px.com/{{site.author.five_hundred_username}}) and feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter_username }}).

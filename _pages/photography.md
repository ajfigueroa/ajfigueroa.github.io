I enjoy photographing still life photos. It's one of my favourite things to do while travelling.

I took this photo with my iPhone on a trip to Tokyo, Japan. This was located in a small park within Meiji Jingu. It was the first time I was alone on this trip.

This photo was also taken on a phone and it was my first time visiting the famous, Machu Picchu. It is hard to grasp that this was built by my ancestors a long time ago. The fact that I got to see it with my family made it much more special.

I've been to New York City a lot of times but this was my first solo trip there. It's very easy to feel lonely in a densely populated city. I wanted to capture how quick a New York minute is.

Most of my photos are on 500px so feel free to follow me there!

Some advice that I received from one of my favourite photographers was simply:
> "Take the photo that you want to see"

My name is Alex and I'm an iOS Engineer from Canada living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Currently, I work at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/). Previously, I've worked at [Wealthsimple](https://wealthsimple.com), [Wattpad](https://wattpad.com), [Kinetic Commerce](https://kineticcommerce.com), and my own startup [WeBeam](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/webeam).

Any opinions made here are completely my own.

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, and taking photos. Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{site.author.twitter_username}}).
